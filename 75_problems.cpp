// Problems using pointers.

/*  1. Uninitialized pointer.  */ 

// We are not supposed to use that pointer unless it is intialized.
// We must make it point on some location, then we can access it.


/*   2. Memory leak.   */

// When we are allocating HEAP memory,
// after it is not required we must de-allocate it and delete it.
// We might go out of memory.


/*   3. Dangling pointer.   */

// will cause runtime error.
